1) null vs undefined

    null: explicitly assigned “no value”.

    undefined: variable declared but not assigned a value.

2) map() vs forEach()

    map(): transforms array, returns a new array.

    forEach(): iterates over array, does not return anything.

3) == vs ===

    ==: checks value after type coercion.

    ===: checks value and type, no coercion.

4) Async/await significance

    Makes asynchronous API calls look synchronous, easier to read and handle promises.

5) Scope in JavaScript

    Global scope: accessible everywhere.

    Function scope: accessible only inside the function.

    Block scope: accessible only inside { } (with let/const).
